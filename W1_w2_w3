What is DevOps?
DevOps is a culture and set of practices that brings Development and Operations teams together to deliver software faster, reliably, and continuously.


A) DevOps Principles


Collaboration & Communication
Break the silos between Dev and Ops.


Automation
Automate build, test, deploy, infrastructure provisioning.


Continuous Integration (CI)
Code changes integrated frequently & tested automatically.


Continuous Delivery (CD)
Ensure software is always in a deployable state.


Continuous Deployment
Automated deployment to production on every commit.


Monitoring & Feedback
Track performance & errors for continuous improvement.


Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
Manage infrastructure through code (Terraform, Ansible).



B) DevOps Practices


Source Code Management – Git, GitHub


CI/CD Pipelines – Jenkins, GitHub Actions


Containerization – Docker


Orchestration – Kubernetes


Configuration Management – Ansible, Puppet, Chef


Monitoring & Logging – Grafana, Prometheus, ELK


Cloud Platforms – AWS, Azure, GCP



C) Role & Responsibilities of a DevOps Engineer
A DevOps Engineer performs:
1. Automation


Automate builds, tests, deployments.


Write CI/CD pipelines.


2. Source Code & Version Control Management


Manage Git repositories.


Enforce branching strategies.


3. Configuration Management


Manage server configurations using Puppet/Ansible.


4. Infrastructure as Code


Write Terraform scripts or CloudFormation.


5. Deployment & Release Management


Perform blue-green, rolling, or canary deployments.


6. Monitoring & Troubleshooting


Set up monitoring dashboards.


Handle cloud/server issues.


7. Collaboration


Bridge gap between developers, testers, and operations teams.




3) Version Control System (VCS) Tools
What is VCS?
A Version Control System is a tool used to:


Track changes in code


Collaborate with team members


Maintain version history


Rollback to previous versions


Types of VCS
1. Centralized VCS


Single central repository
Examples:


SVN (Subversion)


CVS


2. Distributed VCS


Every developer has a local copy of the repo
Examples:


Git (most popular)


Mercurial

4) Install Git & Create GitHub Account
✔ Step 1: Install Git on Windows
1. Download Git
Go to:
https://git-scm.com/downloads
2. Run the Installer


Click Next for default options


Select Git Bash terminal


Choose default editor (VS Code recommended)


Complete installation


3. Verify Installation
Open Git Bash and run:
git --version


✔ Step 2: Configure Git
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your-email@example.com"


✔ Step 3: Create GitHub Account


Go to: https://github.com/


Click Sign Up


Enter email → username → password


Verify account


Create your first repository




5) Basic Git Operations (Hands-on Commands)
1. Create a new folder and initialize Git
mkdir myproject
cd myproject
git init


2. Create a file
echo "Hello DevOps" > file.txt


3. Check status
git status


4. Add file to staging
git add file.txt


5. Commit the file
git commit -m "Initial commit"


6. Connect to GitHub repository
git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/myproject.git


7. Push code to GitHub
git push -u origin main


8. Clone an existing repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/myproject.git


9. Create and switch branches
git branch feature-login
git checkout feature-login


10. Merge a branch into main
git checkout main
git merge feature-login


Result
Successfully:
✔ Understood DevOps principles, practices & DevOps engineer roles
✔ Explored Version Control System (VCS) tools
✔ Installed Git, created a GitHub account, and executed basic Git operations
