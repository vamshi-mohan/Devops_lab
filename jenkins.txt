Below is a **simple, clear, step-by-step guide** to help you understand **Continuous Integration (CI)** by **installing, configuring, and setting up Jenkins** on a **Linux system**.

This guide assumes **Ubuntu/Debian**, but steps are similar for CentOS/RHEL.

---

# ✅ **What is Jenkins? (Simple Explanation)**

Jenkins is an **automation server** used for:

* Continuous Integration (CI)
* Continuous Delivery (CD)
* Automating build, test, and deployment processes

It helps developers automatically build and test code whenever they push changes.

---

# 🟢 **1. Install Jenkins on Linux (Ubuntu/Debian)**

### **Step 1: Update packages**

```
sudo apt update
```

---

### **Step 2: Install Java (required for Jenkins)**

Jenkins runs on Java.

```
sudo apt install openjdk-11-jdk -y
```

Check version:

```
java -version
```

---

### **Step 3: Add Jenkins repository**

```
curl -fsSL https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable/jenkins.io.key | sudo tee \
  /usr/share/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc > /dev/null
```

Add Jenkins repository file:

```
echo deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc] \
  https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable binary/ | sudo tee \
  /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jenkins.list > /dev/null
```

---

### **Step 4: Install Jenkins**

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install jenkins -y
```

---

### **Step 5: Start and Enable Jenkins**

```
sudo systemctl start jenkins
sudo systemctl enable jenkins
```

Check status:

```
systemctl status jenkins
```

Jenkins is now running 🎉

---

# 🟢 **2. Access Jenkins Web Interface**

Open your browser and visit:

```
http://your-server-ip:8080
```

If using local machine:

```
http://localhost:8080
```

You will see the Jenkins unlock screen.

---

# 🟢 **3. Get the Initial Admin Password**

Run:

```
sudo cat /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword
```

Copy the password and paste into the Jenkins UI.

---

# 🟢 **4. Install Suggested Plugins**

On first setup:

* Click **Install Suggested Plugins**
* Wait for installation to complete

---

# 🟢 **5. Create Jenkins Admin User**

Enter:

* Username
* Password
* Full name
* Email

Click **Save and Continue**.

Jenkins setup is complete 👏

---

# 🟢 **6. Create Your First Build Job (Continuous Integration Demo)**

### **Step 1: Go to Jenkins Dashboard**

Click **New Item**

### **Step 2: Enter Job Name**

Example: **MyFirstBuild**

Choose:

* **Freestyle project**
  Click **OK**

---

# 🟢 **7. Configure the Build Job**

Inside job configuration:

### **1. Source Code Management**

If using Git:

* Select **Git**
* Add your repository URL
  Example:

  ```
  https://github.com/your-username/yourrepo.git
  ```

### **2. Build Trigger (Enable CI)**

To build automatically when code is pushed:

✔️ Select **Poll SCM**
Enter schedule:

```
* * * * *
```

(This checks every minute)

OR (better option):

✔️ Use **GitHub Webhook** (Not required for basic demo)

---

### **3. Configure Build Step**

Scroll to **Build** → click **Add build step**

Choose:

**Execute shell**

Add commands, for example:

```
echo "Building the project..."
echo "This is my first Jenkins CI job!"
```

Or real build commands like:

```
npm install
npm test
```

---

### **4. Save the Job**

Click **Save**

---

# 🟢 **8. Run the Build Job**

Click **Build Now** (left sidebar)

You will see:

🔵 #1 (build number)
Click it → Console Output

You should see:

```
Building the project...
This is my first Jenkins CI job!
Finished: SUCCESS
```

Congratulations!
You have successfully created your first **Continuous Integration Pipeline** with Jenkins 🎉

You are getting this error because **Ubuntu 24.04 (Noble)** uses a newer security system, and Jenkins has changed its repository keys recently.
The **old installation commands don't work anymore**.

Don’t worry — I’ll give you the **correct and updated steps** to fix the GPG key error and install Jenkins properly.

---

# ✅ **Fix: Correct Jenkins Installation Steps for Ubuntu 24.04 (Noble)**

## 🔵 **Step 1: Remove the old Jenkins repo file**

Run this:

```
sudo rm /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jenkins.list
```

---

## 🔵 **Step 2: Add the NEW Jenkins key**

Run these updated commands (official):

```
curl -fsSL https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable/jenkins.io-2023.key | \
  sudo tee /usr/share/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc > /dev/null
```

---

## 🔵 **Step 3: Add the NEW Jenkins repository**

Run this:

```
echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc] \
https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable binary/" | \
sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jenkins.list > /dev/null
```

---

## 🔵 **Step 4: Update package list**

```
sudo apt update
```

Now the GPG error should be gone.

---

## 🔵 **Step 5: Install Java (required for Jenkins)**

```
sudo apt install openjdk-17-jdk -y
```

Check:

```
java -version
```

---

## 🔵 **Step 6: Install Jenkins**

Now run:

```
sudo apt install jenkins -y
```

This time it will work ✔️

---

## 🔵 **Step 7: Start Jenkins**

```
sudo systemctl start jenkins
sudo systemctl enable jenkins
```

Check status:

```
systemctl status jenkins
```

---

## 🔵 **Step 8: Access Jenkins UI**

Open your browser:

```
http://localhost:8080
```

Get initial password:

```
sudo cat /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword
```
