### **Aim:**

To install and configure a **pull-based Software Configuration Management and provisioning tool using Puppet**.

---

### **Description:**

**Puppet** is an open-source configuration management tool that automates the provisioning, configuration, and management of systems.
In a **pull-based setup**, Puppet Agents periodically request configuration catalogs from the Puppet Master (Server) and apply them to maintain consistent system states.

This experiment demonstrates:

* Installation of **Puppet Server (Master)** and **Puppet Agent (Client)**.
* Configuration of communication between them.
* Verification of successful **agent–master interaction**.

Puppet ensures system integrity by enforcing desired configurations and automatically correcting any drift from the defined state, making it essential for large-scale IT infrastructure management.

---

### **Procedure:**

#### **Step 1: Install Puppet Repository**

1. Download the Puppet 8 repository package:

   ```bash
   wget https://apt.puppet.com/puppet8-release-focal.deb
   ```
2. Install the repository package:

   ```bash
   sudo dpkg -i puppet8-release-focal.deb
   ```
3. Update package lists:

   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   ```

> This makes the latest Puppet Server and Agent packages available for installation.

---

#### **Step 2: Install Puppet Server**

Install the Puppet Server package:

```bash
sudo apt install puppetserver -y
```

> The Puppet Server acts as the **Master Node**, responsible for managing configurations and catalogs for multiple agents.

---

#### **Step 3: Start and Enable Puppet Server**

```bash
sudo systemctl start puppetserver
sudo systemctl enable puppetserver
```

> This activates the Puppet Server and ensures it starts automatically on boot.

---

#### **Step 4: Configure Puppet Agent**

1. Install the Puppet Agent:

   ```bash
   sudo apt install puppet-agent -y
   ```
2. Edit the configuration file `/etc/puppetlabs/puppet/puppet.conf`:

   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/puppetlabs/puppet/puppet.conf
   ```
3. Add the following under the `[agent]` section:

   ```
   [agent]
   server = puppetmaster.example.com
   environment = production
   runinterval = 30m

   certname = puppet.localdomain
   server = puppet.localdomain
   environment = production
   runinterval = 1h
   ```

> Replace `puppetmaster.example.com` with your Puppet Master’s hostname or IP.

---

#### **Step 5: Start and Enable Puppet Agent**

```bash
sudo systemctl start puppet
sudo systemctl enable puppet
```

> The agent will now periodically contact the Puppet Master to pull and apply configurations.

---

#### **Step 6: Test Puppet Agent Communication**

Manually trigger an agent run:

```bash
sudo /opt/puppetlabs/bin/puppet agent --test
```

Expected Output:

* Agent contacts the Puppet Master.
* Retrieves and applies the configuration catalog.
* Displays “**Applied catalog in X seconds**” message upon success.

> This confirms proper communication between Puppet Master and Agent.

---

### **Conclusion:**

In this experiment, a **pull-based Software Configuration Management** setup was successfully implemented using **Puppet**.
The **Puppet Server (Master)** and **Puppet Agent (Client)** were installed, configured, and connected successfully.
The agent successfully pulled configuration data from the master and applied it locally, confirming proper functionality.

This demonstrates Puppet’s power in **automating configuration management** and ensuring **system consistency** across large-scale infrastructures.
